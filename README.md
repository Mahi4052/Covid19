# Covid19_India Data Exploration and Visualization

# 1. Data Exploration
In exploration of the COVID-19 India dataset, I have conducted a series of crucial SQL queries to extract valuable insights and generate important tables as a result. These queries were essential for structuring and interpreting the data effectively.

Through these important queries, I have accomplished the following:
1. Data Selection and Filtering
2. Aggregation
3. Grouping and Summarization
4. Joining Tables

# 2. Data Visualization
The COVID-19 report is visualized using Tableau.

In the visualization portfolio, we observe the total cases, total deaths, and total recoveries categorized by states on the horizontal (x-axis) and population on the vertical (y-axis).
