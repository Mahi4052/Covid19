# Covid19_India Data Exploration and Visualization

# 1. Data Exploration
In exploration of the COVID-19 India dataset, I have conducted a series of crucial SQL queries to extract valuable insights and generate important tables as a result. These queries were essential for structuring and interpreting the data effectively.

Through these important queries, I have accomplished the following:
1. Data Selection and Filtering
2. Aggregation
3. Grouping and Summarization
4. Creating Derived Tables
5. Joining Tables

# 2. Data Visualization
Then Visualization of covid19 report is done in Tableau.

In the visualization protofolio, we can see total cases, total deaths, and total cures with respect to states on the x-axis and population on the y-axis.
